# üìÑ OCR Reader, üîç Analyzer, and üí¨ Chat Assistant using üîé Zerox, üß† GPT-4o, powered by üöÄ AI/ML API

**What I Built**

I built an **OCR Document Reader** that allows users to upload and extract text from various document types such as PDFs, Word, and documents. The app utilizes the [**Zerox**](https://github.com/getomni-ai/zerox) library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and integrates the **AI/ML API's GPT-4o** model for advanced text analysis. With features like **support for multiple document formats**, **text analysis**, and an interactive interface built with **Gradio 5.0**, this app simplifies the process of extracting and analyzing text from complex documents.

## Limitations

- **Processing Time**: Enabling the `maintain_format` option can slow down processing due to sequential requests needed to preserve formatting.
- **API Constraints**: The app's capabilities depend on the limitations of the AI/ML API plan, such as request quotas and document size restrictions.
- **System Dependencies**: Requires installation of system packages like `poppler-utils`, which may not be straightforward on all platforms.

## Demo

- **Upload Documents**:  
  Users can upload PDFs, Word documents, or images for OCR processing.

- **Extracted Text Display**:  
  The extracted text is displayed within the app, with options to copy or download it.

- **Maintain Formatting**:  
  Optionally preserve the original document's formatting in the extracted text.

### Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Gradio 5.0**: For building the user-friendly interface.
- **Zerox**: Library used for OCR processing.
- **AI/ML API**: Provides the GPT-4o model for text analysis.
- **LiteLLM**: Used under the hood for model interactions.

## More Details

- **Zerox Library**: Transforms uploaded documents into images and performs OCR to extract text.
- **AI/ML API's GPT-4o**: Analyzes the extracted text, enabling advanced features like summarization or content analysis.
- **Gradio Interface**: Offers an intuitive web-based UI for users to interact with the app seamlessly.

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Processing**: Enable users to upload and process multiple documents at once.
2. **Advanced Formatting Preservation**: Improve the ability to retain complex layouts, tables, and graphics.
3. **User Accounts**: Implement authentication to allow users to save and manage their processed documents.
4. **Cloud Integration**: Add options to upload documents from and save results to cloud storage services.

## Running the Repository

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jadouse5/ocr-aimlapi-zerox.git
cd ocr-document-reader

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Install system dependencies
# On Ubuntu/Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils

# On macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install poppler

# 4. Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file in the root directory and add:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.aimlapi.com/v1  # Adjust if necessary

# 5. Run the application
python ocr_app.py

# 6. Open your browser and navigate to
http://localhost:7860
```

**Note**: Replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key for the AI/ML API.
